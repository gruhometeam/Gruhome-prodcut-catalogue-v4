I want you to generate a complete Progressive Web App (PWA) using React + Vite that reads data from a Google Sheet and displays it in a searchable, filterable UI. The goal is an internal product catalog app for my employees. Here are the requirements:

APP PURPOSE:
- Show product data from a Google Sheet (I will later provide the Google Sheet API endpoint as a JSON URL)
- Staff should be able to install the app on Android or iPhone like a native app
- No login for now
- Very fast browsing, search-as-you-type

TECH REQUIREMENTS:
- React + Vite
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Fetch data using a public JSON API URL (temporary placeholder like https://sheet.best/api/sheets/demo until I replace it)
- State management using React hooks only
- Deploy-ready PWA with manifest.json & service worker
- The app must be installable as a PWA on iOS and Android

FEATURES:
- Home screen: Search bar + list of items
- Search must filter by any of these fields:
   BOOK NAME, DESIGN NAME, DESIGN NAME ALT, PRICE CODE
- Optional filters dropdown (PRICE CODE list extracted dynamically)
- Each row card shows: BOOK NAME, DESIGN NAME, PRICE CODE, RRP, GST%
- Clicking a card opens a details page with all fields in the row
- UI should be responsive, clean, quick to scroll

FOLDER STRUCTURE:
src/
  components/
    SearchBar.jsx
    FilterBar.jsx
    ProductCard.jsx
  pages/
    Home.jsx
    Details.jsx
  hooks/
    useProducts.js
public/
  manifest.json
  icons for PWA (generate placeholder icons)

PWA REQUIREMENTS:
- Manifest.json with name, description, icons
- Service worker using Vite PWA plugin or Workbox
- Display mode: standalone
- Theme color: #2E4232 (deep forest green)
- App icon: placeholder with letter "G" in white on green background

DATA FORMAT TEMPLATE (example object):
{
  "BOOK NAME": "F-ARIEL-140",
  "DESIGN NAME": "ARIEL",
  "DESIGN NAME ALT": "ARIEL ALT",
  "PRICE CODE": "A",
  "ROLL": "675",
  "CUT": "758",
  "RRP": "1304",
  "GST%": "5%",
  "HSN": "5407 20 00"
}

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Make sure search matches regardless of uppercase/lowercase
- If Google Sheet fails to load, show a retry button and offline notice
- After generating code, give me instructions to replace the API URL with my own Google Sheet endpoint and deploy

Finally, once done, include step-by-step deployment instructions for Replit hosting and how to turn it into an installable app for staff.
