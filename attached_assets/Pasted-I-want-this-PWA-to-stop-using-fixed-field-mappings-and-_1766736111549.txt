I want this PWA to stop using fixed field mappings and instead become fully dynamic based on the spreadsheet headings.

Please refactor the app as follows:

DATA & STRUCTURE:
- Fetch JSON from the SheetBest API
- Treat the keys of the first row as column headings dynamically
- Display only the first 8 columns (A–H) for now
- Do NOT hardcode field names like RRP, GST — pull headings from the sheet
- If a value is blank or N/A, hide that row in the UI
- When column names change in the spreadsheet, the UI should update automatically without code changes

UI / UX REQUIREMENTS:
- Brand aesthetic: Gruhome colors (primary #A9472A brick red, secondary #393939 charcoal)
- Use a clean modern font like Inter or Poppins
- Product list should show each row as a card:
    * Large title: BOOK NAME + DESIGN NAME (concatenate values from columns 1 & 2)
    * Under title show DESIGN ALT and PRICE CODE if present
    * Display selected fields in a structured list from the dynamic mapping
- Cards must have:
    * rounded corners
    * soft drop shadow
    * hover effect on desktop
    * click/tap to open a modal with all column values
- On mobile: 1 column list view
- On desktop: 2-column masonry/grid layout
- Search bar at the top that filters live across all fields
- Add dropdown filter for PRICE CODE (list unique values dynamically)
- Use skeleton placeholders when loading API data
- Ensure images, icons, and UI scale well on iPhone + Android
- Cards must be fast and responsive

EXTRA REQUIREMENTS:
- Local cache the API data so the PWA works offline once loaded
- Add a small badge that shows GST% highlighted in green
- Add currency formatting for all numeric fields containing prices
- Sort alphabetically by BOOK NAME

OUTPUT:
- Show me the updated key files in src/components and src/pages
- Explain where I should adjust the number of visible columns in case we expand beyond A-H
- After changes, give me a preview link to test

Do not generate placeholder mock data — use my API URL already configured in the project.

When ready, summarize what was changed and what future extension points exist.
