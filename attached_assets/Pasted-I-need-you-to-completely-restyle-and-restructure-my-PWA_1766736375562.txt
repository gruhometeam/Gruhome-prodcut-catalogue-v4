I need you to completely restyle and restructure my PWA UI to look modern, clean and premium — like an Apple or Nicobar design.

Current issues to FIX:
- Cards stretch full width and overflow the screen
- Cards visually cluttered, text cramped
- Product title alignment inconsistent
- Search bar visually weak and too tight
- Filter dropdown too big, poorly designed, limited to only Price Code
- Modal popup goes full black and hides content
- Layout does not feel like a premium brand

STYLE GOALS:
- Aesthetic closer to Good Earth / Nicobar / Arhaus / Muji / Apple
- Minimal, elegant, quiet design
- Color palette: charcoal text (#2E2E2E), subtle sage green accents (#8A9A5B), muted cream background (#F4ECD8)
- Rounded corners 8px on cards
- Soft shadows (not harsh, no borders)
- Padding: 20–32px inside container grid, 16–24px inside cards
- Typography:
    Headings: Cormorant Garamond, serif, medium weight
    Body: Inter or SF Pro, 400 weight
    Values like prices/RRP/GST should be regular weight, not bold
- No full-black backgrounds — use soft charcoal (#1B1B1B) at 80% opacity in modals

LAYOUT SPECS:
- Mobile: 1 column cards, centered, fixed max-width 420px (never full edge-to-edge)
- Tablet/Desktop: responsive grid 2 or 3 columns, equal spacing
- Cards must never overflow viewport
- Search bar fixed at top on scroll (sticky)
- Optional filter panel collapsible under search bar

INTERACTION:
- Clicking card opens modal overlay with full data
- Modal centered, width 90% mobile / 60% desktop, white background
- Modal scrolls internally while background remains static
- No click-outside accidental closing — add close button

DATA MAPPING:
- Use dynamic column reading:
    * read first row as column labels
    * display them as labels in the card in a logical stack:
        Product Name → biggest text
        Columns like: Book Name, Design Name, Design Alt, Price Code, Roll, Cut, RRP, GST%
    * If extra columns appear in future, show them inside modal only
- If a value is blank or "0", hide that line instead of showing "N/A" visually
- Search should match across all columns case-insensitively
- Filters:
    Replace “Price Code” filter with smart multi-filters:
      1) Fabric type / Book Name (dropdown)
      2) Price Code (dropdown)
      3) GST% (dropdown)
      Allow selecting multiple filters simultaneously

FEATURES TO KEEP:
- Offline caching
- “Add to home screen” installability
- Fast local search
- Dynamic loading from JSON API

WHAT TO REMOVE:
- API link displayed in UI
- “xxx products loaded” message
- Horizontal scrolling
- Hard-coded column names in UI

PLEASE DELIVER:
1. Updated responsive layout
2. Polished visual design using the style palette above
3. Proper spacing and typography
4. A card + modal design that feels like a premium furniture brand
5. Multi-filter panel
6. Hide missing fields instead of showing N/A
7. Smooth transitions (modal fade in/out, card hover elevation)
8. Ensure dynamic columns don't break layout
